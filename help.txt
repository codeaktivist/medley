Pick a folder with wav audio files and let this C program
merge all tracks into a medley. To generate your medley,
the program takes some optional parameters:

EXAMPLES

./medley -r /beatles -w beatles.wav -i 40 -d 10 -x 1
Take all wav files in the folder beatles and create the medley
beatles.wav with 10 Seconds (0:40 to 0:50) from each song
using 1 second to blend between them.

./medley /slipknot -i 0 -d 10 -x 0
Take any .wav file in the slipknot folder and generate a 
medley.wav made up of the first 10 seconds of every song.

./medley /coldplay -f elevator.wav -i 40 -d 20 -x 10
Produce some everblending elevator music ;P

REMARKS

The length specified for the crossfade will also be used
for the fade in (first track) and the fade out (last track).
Explicitly setting the crossfade duration to 0 will result 
in a hard and audible cut. A minimum length of 0.1 is 
recommended (100ms). The crossfade cannot be longer than 
the part or the actual song, so a 5 second crossfade on a 
8 second part will result in an error.

LIMITATIONS

- Only uncompressed wave files are supported (.wav, .wave, .bwf)
- Only mono and stereo files are supported
- All files must have the same number of channel
- All files must have the same sample frequency (44.1kHz, 48kHz)
- Only 16 bit files are supported
